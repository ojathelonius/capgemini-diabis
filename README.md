# Woopy - Capgemini Digital Insurer challenge
Woopy is a companion app that guides children through the best practices when it comes to treating diabetes.

It transforms tedious, daily tasks such as blood sugar measuring into a fun game, thanks to its gamification system. Woopy is also a chatbot using IBM Watson to provide relevant answers.

The repository for this chatbot is available [here](https://github.com/proust96/chatbot_back).


## Technical stack

Woopy is a React-Native application using the Expo SDK. It is compiled to native code, and can run on both Android and iOS, although it has only been tested on a OnePlus 5T running Android 8 (Oreo).


## Roadmap
- [x] App graphical identity and color set
- [x] Main UI screens
- [x] Chatbot back-end
- [x] Basic logic structure with Redux
- [x] Link app to chatbot
